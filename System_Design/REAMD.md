### Software design.


#### Design Fundamentals.

- Some jargons

Cache, DB, Load balancer, Polling, Servers, Availability, HTTP, Database, Hashing, MapReduce, Proxies, DNS, Replications., Peer-to-Peer.


- What is design fundamentals?

There are divided into 4 categories.

1- Underlaying and fundamentals knowledge. Such as client and the Server model.


2- Key characterstics. Things that you want the system has such as Availability, latency, throughout, redundency


3- Actual component of a system. Load balancer, proxies,


4- Actual tech. Real exiating tech stack that make use build the actual design.


### Client Server Model.

This is really important because this is the foundation of how computer speak to one another.

Client: A machine that speaks to a server.


Server: A machine that listens for clients and sends back the results.


- The first thing a client does is it creates a DNS query to find what the IP address is of the  server.


What is a DNS query: A special request that goes to a server which asks for the IP address of server.


- Ports: A server listens for requests in a specific port. Any machine that has a distinct IP address has 16000 ports that programs in the machine can listen to.

The client has to specify what ports to listen to.

Analogy: Ports are apartmetns number, IP address is the mailbox


### Network Protocols.
